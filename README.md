# SemanticNetworkFX
This is a study project which aim to implement Semantic networks and three of its major infering techniques : Mark-Propagation, Inheritance and exceptions.

## Features
* [x] Ability to create a semantic network defined by a set of nodes and relations.
* [x] Mark-propagation algorithm provide the ability to infer solutions - if there's any - to the question concerning the existance of a certain relation between 2 nodes or more.
* [x] Saturate the network (infer everything that can be using Inheritance algorithm).
* [x] Deduce all the properties relating to a specific node.
* [x] Displat the network's graph view
